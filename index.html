                It's close to midnight, and<br>
                Something evil's lurking in the dark<br>
                Under the moonlight<br>
                You see a sight that almost stops your heart<br>
                You try to scream<br>
                But terror takes the sound before you make it<br>
                You start to freeze<br>
                As horror looks you right between the eyes<br>
                You're paralyzed

                You hear the door slam<br>
                And realize there's nowhere left to run<br>
                You feel the cold hand<br>
                And wonder if you'll ever see the sun<br>
                You close your eyes<br>
                And hope that this is just imagination, girl<br>
                But all the while<br>
                You hear the creature creeping up behind<br>
