                You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it<br>
                You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes<br>

                You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun<br>
                You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl<br>
                But all the while, you hear the creature creeping up behind<br>
